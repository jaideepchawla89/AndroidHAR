application todo and documentation

1) analyse orientation after increasing interval and see if orientation filter works
2)make notification and startForeground() work. application possibly not working because of start foreground error. Build notifications properly
3) acquire wakelock properly
4) Memory usage over time , read about android studio device monitor and look for possible plugins that give additional data
5)Work on network connectivity: Maybe test it out on thingsspeak.com
6) read about handling redundancy in files
7) Three tier architecture: If phone not connected store on device. If phone not connected to server store on phone else
   8) Maybe instead of plain runnables try an executor service for phone sensors and android wear
   9) App works when I do not explicitly pass personname and activity name as parameters. Maybe need to set a flag to take care of that
   if the values of person name and activity name have been set update the flag and then check if the flag has been upated just use pre existing values
